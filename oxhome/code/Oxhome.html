(live: 2s)[The framed clipping memorializes the (link-reveal:&quot;startling&quot;)[(show:?shock)] headline, dated 1908.(stop:)]

|shock)[The shock of discovering people on the other half of the globe had been magnified a dozen-fold the moment it was discovered that those people *outscaled* us a dozen-fold. The Northerners had been surprised too, of course, but they knew nothing of the (link-reveal:&quot;fear&quot;)[(show:?fear)] that had gripped the South at this discovery.]

|fear)[Everyone was terrified of the ease with which even one of these giants might invade the South, able to brush aside our infantry like rats. The children were haunted by nightmares of being devoured by these beasts, with their man-high mouths and capable teeth, and many a mother had whispered comforts she didn&#39;t quite believe to her babe.

The (link-reveal:&quot;linguists&quot;)[(show:?linguists)] had been the saving grace of the expedition. ]

|linguists)[They&#39;d been in communication for years at that point and had established quite the camaraderie. Fortunately, each party had brought along a few. Doctors Hammarström and Evans managed to smoothe over the shock of the encounter with inane, humanizing chatter about the climate, their respective wives, and so on. 

Without them, you wonder whether everyone would have gone home and pretended nothing had ever happened.

You don’t need to ask. You know where you stand among the typewriter girls.

“I see, thank you.”

“Right, then. As I said, the Northerner begins work tomorrow, so you should spend the rest of the day preparing. They’ve built an office for him on the North edge of campus, past the gardens. It’s impossible to miss. Here’s the key.”

That means nothing to you, but your imagination is more than happy to fill the gaps of his description with a hulking brute. You squeeze your eyes shut and force the picture from your head before speaking.

“Thank you, sir.” You manage, rising to your feet, white knuckles still buried in your skirt. “If that is all?”

Dr. Blackwill nods absently, already turning his attention to the papers on his desk, and you depart.

Most of the girls specialize like this; becoming familiar with the vocabulary of an area, even if only in spelling, does wonders for both speed and accuracy of transcription. Words like &quot;combinatorial&quot; and &quot;surjection&quot; are burned into the nerves of your hands, though you couldn&#39;t possibly guess what they mean. And, of course, it has helped to become acquainted with the style of penmanship of the individual faculty. After the past few years, you&#39;d swear you could write a letter indistinguishable from one by Dr. Chapman, the most prolific in the department.

This relationship only goes as deep as handwriting, however. Campus couriers handle the delivery of manuscripts, so your knowledge of these men stops with the quality of their descenders and the tone of their prose. Dr. Symon is a patient and compassionate correspondent, but his handwriting is ambiguous at best, with scrawled letterforms that seem unwilling to commit to an identity. Dr. Evans&#39;s hand is precise and hardly needs transcribing; his words are just as exacting. Dr. Chapman is an effusive writer, smudged ink and forward slant belying his enthusiasm.

When you had first begun your post, Ms. Sheffield tasked you with learning the name and position of all tenured faculty, so that you would not err in spelling their names, and so that you would assign the proper importance to their correspondence. You type slowly and carefully when a document comes from Dr. Blackwell. As chair of the department, his writing is frequently less technical than that of his colleagues, but his status demands extra deliberation. It would not do to irritate such an important man.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="toBlackwell" tags="" position="227,736" size="100,100">The typing pool sits in the basement of Radcliffe Hall, located on the southern edge of campus. The aging building used to house the classicists, who departed the leaking building for greener pastures some years ago. Radcliffe now houses much of the clerical staff supporting Oxhome, with the women sequestered on the bottom floor. 

Despite its position on the outskirts, Radcliffe Hall isn&#39;t really far from anywhere; Oxhome is a dense place, and the department of mathematics is only a fifteen minutes walk away. 

You don&#39;t need to ask for Dr. Blackwill&#39;s address; dozens of missives have impressed it indelibly in your mind: [[Blair Hall, room 203.-&gt;radio room]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="confrontation" tags="" position="1044.6666666666665,360.16666666666674" size="100,100">By the time you make it to the office, the sun has dipped below the horizon. You enter through your door--the normal door--and Mattias looks up from a book he&#39;s reading, clearly surprised to see you this late, or perhaps at all. He puts down the book and crouches to speak with you. Before he can say anything, before you can lose your nerve, you (link-reveal:&quot;attack&quot;)[(show:?attack)].

&quot;You didn&#39;t do anything wrong.&quot;

(link-reveal:&quot;\&quot;Then why?\&quot;&quot;)[(show:?why)]]

|why)[&quot;Because...&quot; He trails off, looking away. &quot;Because I make you uncomfortable.&quot;

&quot;No, you don&#39;t, I am perfectly fine with this arrangement.&quot;

|every)[&quot;Every time I speak, or try to touch you, or am even in the same room as you, you shake like a leaf. You&#39;re the only one in this infernal continent who&#39;s forced to be nice to me and you can&#39;t even look me in the eye! When are you damned Southerners going to understand that I&#39;m not going to hurt you?&quot; 

You&#39;ve never seen him angry like this before. In your terror, you begin to step backwards towards the (link-reveal:&quot;exit&quot;)[(show:?exit)].]

|exit)[A wild look takes roost in his eyes. &quot;Look,&quot; he says, and one of his huge hands captures you before you can react. &quot;I can be gentle.&quot; Consumed by panic, you squirm in his grasp, using every ounce of your strength to push against the fingers enclosing you. They&#39;re like padded steel, unyielding against your struggles. 

Mattias methodically tightens his grasp until your arms are pinned at your sides and all you can do is wriggle. The heat of his proximity is suffocating, and you feel like your heart might explode in your chest. He lifts his fist, and you&#39;re forced to (link-reveal:&quot;regard&quot;)[(show:?enunciate)] him face-to-face.]

|enunciate)[&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; he enunciates, &quot;going to hurt you. I know how to be gentle. I am very angry right now,&quot; you feel your prison grow a little tighter, &quot;but I am gentle enough to keep you safe.&quot;

&quot;I could step on you and not hurt you,&quot; he continues wildly. &quot;I could bite you and not hurt you. You are always so afraid of me when I am eating, but I am not going to hurt you because I am not a [[monster]].&quot; His voice breaks on the word &quot;monster,&quot; saturated with pain. He draws you away from his face and you hear him take a strangled breath. &quot;I know I&#39;ve just made it worse,&quot; he manages eventually, voice thick, &quot;but I&#39;m not, I&#39;m really not.&quot;]

It&#39;s not clear whether this is a conscious choice, but your entire being is soon overtaken by the lub-dub of his foreign heart. You can feel and (link-reveal:&quot;hear&quot;)[(show:?deeper)] nothing but his hitching breaths and the pumping of his blood. It seems impossible to think.

|deeper)[Deeper vibrations wrack your body as Mattias begins to speak. You no longer understand the words resonating through your bones, but some remote part of you registers that he&#39;s reverted to Northern. The crooning feels like an (link-reveal:&quot;apology&quot;)[(show:?apology)].]

|apology)[The fingers re-tighten around you briefly as you&#39;re withdrawn from his chest and ferried back to earth. It&#39;s hard to find your footing--your legs tremble beneath you and you cling to his fingers longer than you would like. There are damp round spots soaked into the wooden floor around you. Mattias draws back onto his haunches and looks away, ashamed.

You feel utterly overwhelmed, but maybe the adrenaline is enough for you to [[flee]]. Then again, [[maybe not-&gt;overwhelmed]].]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="overwhelmed" tags="" position="933,821.8333333333335" size="100,100">Hyperventilating, you fall to your knees, then to all fours. Your entire body is shuddering like it just escaped an icy lake, cracked sobs falling from your throat. You&#39;re too overwhelmed to notice that Mattias has shifted before you feel the pressure of one of his enormous fingers skating down your spine. You realize he&#39;s been speaking for some time now.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, *lilla du*,&quot; he says. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s not your fault. I shouldn&#39;t have taken it out on you.&quot;

The floor is no longer close enough for you, and you tip to the side, collapsing to a full-on fetal position. Mattias ceases his petting and withdraws to consider. The weight of his hand is replaced by his scarf, which he lays carefully over your body.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, we can speak tomorrow.&quot;

You only [[leave-&gt;backHome]] when you&#39;re completely sure he&#39;s gone.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="flee" tags="" position="1173,821.8333333333335" size="100,100">You don&#39;t waste a moment in sprinting for the door, leaving it hanging open in your haste to escape. You run almost halfway home before hitching sobs overtake your breathing and you&#39;re forced to stop, sagging against the wall of a shuttered bakery.

You inspect yourself for a cracked rib, bruises, any evidence besides your shaking hands of what just transpired, but find nothing. Mattias had indeed been gentle, in his way. 

You don your nightgown and slip under the covers, which feel impossibly light. In fact, after your earlier constriction your whole body feels unbounded, as though threatening to float apart. Disturbed, you twist yourself tighter in your sheets, refusing to consider why you need to simulate these sensations.
