#### CONTACT ESTABLISHED WITH GIANTS OF THE NORTH

(live: 2s)[The framed clipping memorializes the (link-reveal:&quot;startling&quot;)[(show:?shock)] headline, dated 1908.(stop:)]

|shock)[The shock of discovering people on the other half of the globe had been magnified a dozen-fold the moment it was discovered that those people *outscaled* us a dozen-fold. The Northerners had been surprised too, of course, but they knew nothing of the (link-reveal:&quot;fear&quot;)[(show:?fear)] that had gripped the South at this discovery.]

|fear)[Everyone was terrified of the ease with which even one of these giants might invade the South, able to brush aside our infantry like rats. The children were haunted by nightmares of being devoured by these beasts, with their man-high mouths and capable teeth, and many a mother had whispered comforts she didn&#39;t quite believe to her babe.

The (link-reveal:&quot;linguists&quot;)[(show:?linguists)] had been the saving grace of the expedition. ]

|linguists)[They&#39;d been in communication for years at that point and had established quite the camaraderie. Fortunately, each party had brought along a few. Doctors Hammarström and Evans managed to smoothe over the shock of the encounter with inane, humanizing chatter about the climate, their respective wives, and so on. 

Without them, you wonder whether everyone would have gone home and pretended nothing had ever happened.

The sound Dr. Blackwill&#39;s [[office door-&gt;officedoor]] creaking open interrupts that thought.]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="globe" tags="" position="370.33333333333326,669.3333333333334" size="100,100">With a single push, the globe is spinning smoothly on its axis. You idly let the ridges at its hemisphere catch on your fingertips, dragging it to a halt. A jagged belt of mountains and glaciers encircles the sphere, a circumferential range known as (link-reveal:&quot;The Ring&quot;)[(show:?ring)]. 

|ring)[Your planet&#39;s dual suns keep the land around each pole a habitable temperature, but the rugged geology and frigid temperatures at the hemisphere render it (link-reveal:&quot;inhospitable&quot;)[(show:?inhospitable)].]

“Yes, come in, come in.”

The department head is a rather rotund old man, with more hair on his upper lip than the whole of his scalp. He stares up at you from a trench of paperwork, a confused look on his face.

“I’m Charlotte Reid,&quot; you offer. &quot;Mrs. Sheffield said you sent for me?”

&quot;The North... sir, do you mean Caeredin?&quot;

&quot;No, Miss Reid, I mean *The North*. Sweoland.&quot; 

You start at the revelation, mind already racing with the consequences.

&quot;I-- I see.” Your heart accelerates, and you stare blankly into your lap, squeezing the fabric of your skirt. A grounding question. “When will this all be happening?&quot;

&quot;The gentleman arrived yesterday and has been settling in. His residency will last the summer. Starting now, you report to me, and your duties begin tomorrow.” 

You’re suffused with another wash of panic. *So soon! Why?

“Mrs. Sheffield recommended you,” he responds. “You’d have to ask her why.” 

You don’t need to ask. You know where you stand among the typewriter girls.

“I see, thank you.”

“Right, then. As I said, the Northerner begins work tomorrow, so you should spend the rest of the day preparing. They’ve built an office for him on the North edge of campus, past the gardens. It’s impossible to miss. Here’s the key.”

[[&quot;Is there anything else you can tell me about him?”-&gt;blackwill3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="blackwill3" tags="" position="361,1886" size="100,100">“Oh, I suppose I ought to give you his name.

That means nothing to you, but your imagination is more than happy to fill the gaps of his description with a hulking brute. You squeeze your eyes shut and force the picture from your head before speaking.

“Thank you, sir.” You rise to your feet, white knuckles still buried in your skirt. “If that is all?”

Dr. Blackwill nods absently, already turning his attention to the papers on his desk, and you depart.

Most of the girls specialize like this; becoming familiar with the vocabulary of an area, even if only in spelling, does wonders for both speed and accuracy of transcription. Words like &quot;combinatorial&quot; and &quot;surjection&quot; are burned into the nerves of your hands, though you couldn&#39;t possibly guess what they mean. And, of course, it has helped to become acquainted with the style of penmanship of the individual faculty. After the past few years, you&#39;d swear you could write a letter indistinguishable from one by Dr. Chapman, the most prolific in the department.

This relationship only goes as deep as handwriting, however. Campus couriers handle the delivery of manuscripts, so your knowledge of these men stops with the quality of their descenders and the tone of their prose. Dr. Symon is a patient and compassionate correspondent, but his handwriting is ambiguous at best, with scrawled letterforms that seem unwilling to commit to an identity. Dr. Evans&#39;s hand is precise and hardly needs transcribing; his words are just as exacting. Dr. Chapman is an effusive writer, smudged ink and forward slant belying his enthusiasm.

When you had first begun your post, Ms. Sheffield tasked you with learning the name and position of all tenured faculty, so that you would not err in spelling their names, and so that you would assign the proper importance to their correspondence. You type slowly and carefully when a document comes from Dr. Blackwell. As chair of the department, his writing is frequently less technical than that of his colleagues, but his status demands extra deliberation. It would not do to irritate such an important man.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="toBlackwell" tags="" position="119.99999999999989,844.3333333333335" size="100,100">The typing pool sits in the basement of Radcliffe Hall, located on the southern edge of campus. The aging building used to house the classicists, who departed the leaking building for greener pastures some years ago. Radcliffe now houses much of the clerical staff supporting Oxhome, with the women sequestered on the bottom floor. 

Despite its position on the outskirts, Radcliffe Hall isn&#39;t really far from anywhere; Oxhome is a dense place, and the department of mathematics is only a fifteen minutes walk away. 

You don&#39;t need to ask for Dr. Blackwill&#39;s address; dozens of missives have impressed it indelibly in your mind: [[Blair Hall, room 203.-&gt;radio room]]</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
